## 6502asm-sublime ##

Syntax definition for 6502 assembler for Sublime Text 3.

### Installation ###

Ideally, you would install this syntax definition through [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/): Preferences/Package Control/Install Package/6502asm-sublime. However, the current version of this package is not on package control yet. Work in progress.

Alternatively, you can download this repository and copy the contents into a folder called 6502asm-sublime in your Sublime [packages directory](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/basic_concepts.html#the-packages-directory).

You will probably need to restart Sublime.
